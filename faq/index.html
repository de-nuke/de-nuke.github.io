                        I'm a Computer Science graduate – I've got Master of Science in Warsaw University of Technology.
                        I've got my job after the second year of studies so today I have more than 5 years of
                        professional experience.

                        I specialize in back-end web applications in Python/Django, but I've also worked in
                        FrontEnd and non-webdev projects. I'm familiar with software design, modelling domains and
                        analyzing business requirements.

                        I like to approach problems methodically and analytically. It's important to me to have the
                        problem clearly defined along with additional information, such as context, the goal,
                        requirements and definition of done.
                    </div>

                    <div>
                        Having problem domain specified in details, I start analyzing it and looking for the solution at
                        the same time. I like to plan my work "backwards". Starting from the most general goal, I trace
                        back what need to be achieved to complete the goal. Once it defined, I look further to what
                        needs to be achieved to have this thing done – finally getting to the current state or
                        detecting the errors and inaccuracy in the logic.

                    <div>
                        Only after such analysis of the problem I start actually solving it.

                        I have a good analytical mind focused on solving problems. I'm good at spotting errors and
                        inaccuracies. I like to investigate how something works and then streamline in to function even
                        better.

                        In my work I'm also diligent and precise always trying to make things the best I
                        can. Thanks to a lot of research and conversations, I usually complete my tasks exactly as
                        expected, without a need to correct them.

                        In a group I'm a non-conflict person who stress importance of getting along. Before leaping into
                        action, I check many things beforehand to reduce misunderstandings and miscommunications between
                        people as much as I can.

                        My strengths have their price which can be my weakness. I tend to spend sometimes too much time
                        on planning, checking and consulting things before staring my tasks. Also, being a non-conflict
                        person who tries to avoid disagreements makes it sometimes harder to make a decision.

                    First thing I consider the most important is to understand. It's crucial to know exactly what both
                    sides of the conflicts want to say and what is their view and position. It gives the complete
                    picture of the conflict which is required to handle it correctly.

                    To appease the conflict, I will try to make both parties find a common goal. Then I would like to
                    meet all the needs which are not contrary to each other. What we are left with after that is the
                    core of the conflict. Only then I can use my experience and knowledge to decide what to do and which
                    party to support.

                        in business requirement analysis, organizing work, discussing with client his different ideas
                        and suggestions.

                        the background processing tasks, not directly connected to the website. Most of my time I was
                        planning and designing new parts of the existing architecture or improving existing ones. I have
                        refactored and completely change the core functionality of the platform. In terms of
                        development, I was mostly simplifying and streamlining processes to make services work better
                        and be less error-prone. I liked to use flowcharts and diagrams to clear the view for me.

                        requirements. I have also supervised the work of another, less experienced developer.

                        before development as well as writing down requirements. It was a short project focused for
                        clients of insurance and assistance services companies and their agents that generate additional
                        income thanks to a network of business partners. I've worked on it for about 3 months.

                    It was a big real-estate platform, which technically consisted of several services working together
                    on BackEnd. I was assigned a large task (estimated for several months) to significantly change
                    the core functionality of the portal, which everything (even business) was built around.

                    It took me a lot of planning, designing and much consultation with other team member to prepare for
                    this change. Then, slowly, step-by-step, I was replacing the old logic with new conditions in 3
                    cooperating backend services. The task was a success and it even has finished within the deadline.

                    I always try to listen and understand their needs and point of view. This is important to me as it
                    lets me develop the software they want. While collaborating with other I am non-conflict person
                    always looking for agreement and common values. In a team, I focus on everyone individually, because
                    I believe everyone is different and requires a different approach.

                    I believe the most important thing is to understand the second side (client or business) and to have
                    both problems and requirements very clearly defined. This is very important as it allows to deeply
                    and precisely analyse the project, which is the direct dependency of a successful project.

                    To me, the above is more important than exact planning and sticking to deadlines. If we exactly know
                    the context and the goal, then planning and deadlines won't be problem.
